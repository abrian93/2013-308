## Homework and Exams
- Homework: assigned weekly and will use WebAssign, which is online.  I will not accept any late homework, but will drop the lowest 2 homework grades. (Note: I'm using WebAssign because I would like to create a competing product that is better, so please let me know every idea you have about how to improve on it!)
- Midterm and final exam: three in-class exams, which will consist of problems similar to those assigned as homework
 - Midterm 1: April 24
 - Midterm 2: May 15
- Grade: Homework - 15%, Midterm 1 - 25%, Midterm 2 - 25%, and Final - 35%
